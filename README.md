# SportsBetting
This repo contains project code and written report for the Professional Fighter's league betting analysis done for Syracuse University IST718 course. This project was completed with other students, Mark P., George S., and Brandon B. 

## Project Overview
The task for this project was to create a data set and follow the OSEMN method (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, iNterpret) to analyze the dataset and provide detailed answers and actions for questions that can be formed by the data. 

## Data
A partner in our group webscraped professional fighter's data (fight stats, historical fight records, fighter height and weight, etc.) using BeautifulSoup and Selenium in Python and created a database for us to use for this project. Around 600 observations were included. Each observation is a fighter's stats and win or loss outcome for the fight listed in that row. 

## What are we looking to answer?
Can the winner of each boxing fight be predicted with high accuracy? More importantly, can we create a profitable betting strategy based on historical odds and fight outcomes that allows us to have an edge over sportsbooks?
